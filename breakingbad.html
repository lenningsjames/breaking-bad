    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Breaking Bad</em> is an American television series that explores the descent of a mild-mannered chemistry teacher, Walter White, into the violent world of drug manufacturing and distribution. Faced with a terminal lung cancer diagnosis and mounting financial pressures, Walter partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, to produce and sell high-quality crystal methamphetamine. What begins as a desperate act of survival quickly evolves into a dark transformation driven by pride, ego, and power.

    <h2>Main Themes</h2>
    <p>
      The series is a complex character study wrapped in a narrative that delves into morality, identity, consequence, and the human capacity for transformation. Walter White's journey from a sympathetic protagonist to a morally bankrupt antihero serves as the show's centerpiece.

      Themes of duality, secrecy, addiction, family, and the corrupting influence of ambition are interwoven throughout the series. The story examines how far someone will go to protect those they love—or to preserve their own legacy.
